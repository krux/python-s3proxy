# python-s3proxy

A script which works as a simple http proxy to an s3 bucket. Useful for accessing non-public s3 buckets via HTTP. Supports automatic serving of index.html when a URL ends in / and automatic building of simple indexes when index.html does not exist. Built for the specific use-case of hosting a private pypi repository in s3.
